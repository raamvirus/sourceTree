//Another way to launch an app by defining an object that extends the App Trait
//Code in the body of object is automatically run, just as if it were inside a min method



object M1App extends App {
  println("Hello, world!")
}

//From cmd of the workspace
//scalac M1_2App.scala
//scala M1App


//In Scala prompt
//:load M1_2App.scala
//M1App.main(Array())
